# Mind Map Markdown

This is a tool to convert markdown files to a realtime mind map. Markdown has become the ubiquitous format for writing notes. This tool allows you to visualize your notes in a mind map format. It is a tool to help you organize your thoughts and ideas. Speaking for myself, whenever I write something down, I end up not using it again. I hope that with this tool I become a bit more disciplined and use my notes more often.

## Features (ToDo)
I want to version this project's planning along with its sources as an experiment. It seems like a good idea to be using it as a test bed.

Let's jot done some unrefined ideas:
- [ ] Add basic usage and setup instructions.
- [ ] Open markdown file when you click on the corresponding node in the mind map.
- [ ] Acceptable theme for the mind map.
- [ ] Some layout controls for the mind map.
- [ ] Maybe make a plugin for VSCode to make it easier to use.
- [ ] Maybe use electron or heck go native. I love KDE so maybe a KDE app.
- [ ] TDD or die (I normally don't do it because if feels like a huge energy drain).
- [ ] Maybe support serialization of the mind map to github compatible format.
